# DISCOVER ENVIRONMENTS FROM ARTIFACTS
#
# A single terraform-plan.yml run may have planned one environment (a
# workflow_dispatch run) or several (a pull_request that touched more than
# one environment's Terraform files). Rather than requiring the caller to
# already know which, this scans every downloaded plan artifact under the
# given directory for a deployment-metadata.json, reads its "environment"
# field, and returns the JSON array of what it found.
#
# Usage:
#   discover-environments-from-artifacts.sh <download-directory>
#
# Expects <download-directory> to contain one subdirectory per downloaded
# artifact (actions/download-artifact's default layout when multiple
# artifacts match a pattern), each containing a deployment-metadata.json.
